# MiniTPL

The goal of the MiniTPL template engine is to provide a miniature
framework which allows you to rapidly create and consume
Smarty-like templates without adding the overhead of Smarty to
your choice of a PHP framework.

In benchmarks the speed of Mini TPL is very close to PHP itself.
All that is usually needed for Mini TPL is a 3KB PHP code overhead.
So it beats Smarty, and usual PHP vsprintf and str_replace functionality.

With a total size of about 13KB and the functionality contained, this is
one of the smallest full featured template engines for PHP to date.
